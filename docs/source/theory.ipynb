    "# The Hierarchical Gaussian Filter\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce the main oncepts on which the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF) is based. We describe the main equations and illustrate the examples with Python code. We start with the generative model of the HGF, which describes how the model assume that the data is being generated. This generative structure is then used to filter the observation (i.e. the sensory part of the model), which is then used by the agent to produce behaviors (i.e. the action part of the model). Next, we show how this model can be \"inverted\" and used by an agent to infer parameter values that generated the sensory inputs. From there, we discuss the notion of prediction error and how derivations of the model can be used to infer probability densities given observed behavioural outcomes."

This is because usually, we think about the beginning of a timepoint trial as starting with receiving a new input, and of a prediction as being present before that input is received (this is especially relevant to model time points as trial in an experiemnts). However, in some variants of the HGF the prediction also depends on the time that has passed in between trials, which is something that can only be evaluated once the new input arrives - hence the additional computation of the (current) prediction in the beginning of the trial. Conceptually, it makes most sense to think of the prediction as happening continuously between trials. For implementational purposes, it is however most convenient to only compute the prediction once the new input (and with it its arrival time) enters. This ensures both that the posterior means of parent nodes have had enough time to be sent back to their children for preparation for the new input, and that the arrival time of the new input can be taken into account appropriately.\n",

  \caption{Overview of possible layer-specific message passing in \textsf{VAPE} coupling. Assignment of nodes to layers is loosely based on figure 3 in \cite{Shipp2016}, reproduced in this document in figure \ref{fig:shipp}. Connections with arrowheads indicate positive influences, or excitatory connections, while connections with circular heads indicate inhibitory influences.}

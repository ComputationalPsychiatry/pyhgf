  \caption{Zoomed-in version of the coupling between a hierarchical level $i$ with its parent $i+1$ in the case of \textsf{VOPE} coupling. Note that the coupling is of \textsf{VOPE} type within level $i$, to update $\check{\mu}_i$, which is turn predicted by level $i+1$, where the higher level now serves as a \textsf{VAPE} parent to the volatility estimate $\check{\mu}_i$.}

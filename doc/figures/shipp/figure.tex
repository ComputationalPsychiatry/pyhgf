	\caption{A template circuit diagram to implement predictive coding. All computational units are designated to be subclasses of excitatory pyramidal neurons: expectation units (rectangular, ‘Exp’), prediction error units (circular, ‘Err’), or precision units (triangular, ‘Prc’). Precision signals are shown to arise from layers 2 and 3A, and form a descending chain of transmission through the superficial layers (pathway 12); these signals are capable of modulating pyramidal error units via their apical dendrite.
